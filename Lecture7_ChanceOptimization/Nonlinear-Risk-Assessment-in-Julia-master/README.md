# Julia Code For Nonlinear Risk Assessment

**Risk = probability (g(x)>=0)  where x is a random vector and g(x)>=0 is a nonlinear safety constraint.**

- Example:  Probability ( -x(1)^4+0.5*(x(1)^2-x(2)^2)+0.1 >=0 ) where, x1 hase Uniform probability distribution over [0,1] and x2 has Beta(1.3,3) probability distribution over [0,1].
